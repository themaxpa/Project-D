        <p class="p-txt">In line with article 17 of the basic EU data protection regulations, we will keep your data only as long as necessary for the respective<br>purposes for which we process your data. If we process data for a number of purposes, they are automatically deleted or stored in a<br>format that does not permit conclusions to be drawn directly as regards your person as soon as the last specific task has been<br>performed. To ensure that all of your data are deleted in line with the principle of data minimization and article 17 of the basic EU data<br>protection regulations, HTA has created an internal deletion concept. The fundamental principles by which this deletion concept<br>envisages the deletion of your personal data are described below.</p>

        <p class="p-txt">To comply with contractual obligations, data acquired from you can be kept for as long as the contract is in force and - depending on the nature<br>and scope of the contract - for 6 or 10 years beyond this point in order to comply with legal requirements for preservation<br>and to ensure clarification of any queries or claims after the end of the contract.</p>

        <p class="p-txt">Personal data are processed by HTA employees, and by service providers we have commissioned, preferably within the EU.</p>

        <p class="p-txt">A cookie is a small file that stores internet settings. Almost every website uses cookie technology. It is downloaded by your internet<br>browser on the first visit to a website. The next time this website is opened with the same user device, the cookie and the information<br>stored in it is either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party<br>cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and in some cases to vary the<br>displayed content.</p>
